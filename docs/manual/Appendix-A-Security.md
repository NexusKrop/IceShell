# Security

IceShell does not implement additional security features or boundaries besides the operating system security boundaries. This may change at a later date.

You should refrain from having any untrusted party or system accessing any instances of IceShell on any system. If you know what you are doing, you can try using advanced security features of your Operating System to try to secure IceShell - we recommend sandboxing it.
